      Ecologically, oak-hickory forests play a foundational role in stabilizing and enriching landscapes. Their deep roots reduce soil erosion, promote groundwater recharge, and help regulate hydrology â€“ benefits that extend well beyond forest boundaries and contribute to overall watershed health.

      Structural Diversity & Habitat Quality<br>

    <div class="card-face back">
      The open canopy structure typical of oak woodlands allows sunlight to reach the forest floor, supporting a rich herbaceous understory. This layer supports a wide range of pollinators, reptiles, invertebrates, and birds, contributing to high overall biodiversity. These environmental functions build ecosystem resilience and maintain biodiversity.

      Biodiversity & Wildlife Support<br>

    <div class="card-face back">
      Mast-producing oaks and hickories feed over 90 species of birds and mammals. In these ecosystems, it is often the ground layer that harbors the greatest species richness. Restoration of these open systems thus has cascading ecological benefits, especially for regional and migratory species that depend on disturbance-maintained habitats.

      Hundreds of insect species depend on oaks for life history. Which in turn supports a multitude of wildlife. The oak genus is the most important family for Lepidoptera, which are an important and favored meal for songbirds and their young.
